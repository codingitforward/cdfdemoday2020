### Introduction
The Civic Digital Fellowship is the first of its kind data science and technology internship program for innovative students to solve pressing problems in federal agencies. Summer 2020 marked our first-ever virtual iteration of the Fellowship due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We are grateful for our six agency partners who worked to make this summer a success despite the circumstances: the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov), [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov), [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/), [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov), [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/), and [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services](https://www.uscis.gov/). The Civic Digital Fellowship also wouldn't be possible without support from our generous supporters: Schmidt Futures, the Ford Foundation, and the Knight Foundation.

Meet the fourth, and first-ever virtual, cohort of Civic Digital Fellows: [Introducing the 2020 Civic Digital Fellows](https://blog.codingitforward.com/introducing-the-2020-civic-digital-fellows-28e28b16eddb).

This repository features the slides that Fellows presented during their respective end-of-summer presentations at their host agencies.
